# 02-Kelbeys-Portfolio
Hello there, this is my week 2 project for the OSU Boot Camp and will also be my portfolio I will grow.
In my portfolio you will be able to read about me, find some areas for my projects that I will work on in the future, and there is a contact me section where I have provided my phone number, email address, and GitHub page(will add a social media in the future).
You can use the navagtion links in the top right to help navigate to certain sections in my portfolio. 
You can access my first homework assignment I had at the OSU boot camp. 
To access that assignment, you have to click on the Run Buddy image, and from there it will redirect you to my first assignment.
I wanted to make the portfolio responsive all the way down to 412px max-width but unfortunately for some reason I can't get media queries to work past 1138px. But I will be continuing to improve the code on my portfolio and improve it overall.
